# Git on the Command Line

We can use the git version control application directly from the command line. Here are some useful commands to get started.

- `git init` Creates a git repository in the folder you're currently working in. Do not nest one git repository folder inside of another.
- `git status` Gives the current status of your git repository.
- `git add .` 'Stage' all current changes so they're ready to be committed.
- `git commit -m "Your Message"` Take all staged changes and create a snapshot of the current state of your repository. Using commits is how we generate a *commit history* for our repository.
- `git pull` Grab any changes from your remote repository (e.g. GitHub.com) and pull them down onto your local repository (the one on your computer).
- `git push` Take whatever commits you have on your computer and push them to the remote repository.

There are a lot of things to learn when it comes to working with git, but these commands are the day-to-day ones that you will do when working with version control.

**TIP:** You should make frequent, small commits when working on your projects.
